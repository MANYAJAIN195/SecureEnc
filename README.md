# SecureEnc

Due to recent developments in Cryptanalysis, providing security to personal contents, and messages using cryptography has become difficult. By using SECUREENC you can encrypt and decrypt your data either in the form of text or file, in just a matter of seconds. You get to choose the algorithm you want to encrypt your data with and while decrypting we'll just require your key.
